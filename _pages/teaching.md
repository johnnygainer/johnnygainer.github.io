Both spring and fall semester I teach a course to engineering students at Villanova University where we examine the intersection of communication and science.

<h3>Proposed course for incoming freshman</h3>

Prof. John Gainer, Adjunct Faculty, Villanova University
Course: Hacking Our Futures: Technology, Media, and its Cultural Construction
Course Description
Proposals to colonize Mars, the rise of automated vehicles, the use of memes to manipulate
global economics. What are the cultural impacts of these new technologies? Who benefits and
who falls behind with the rapid development of modern media and technology? How has
everyday life fundamentally changed with each new advancement?
The goal of this course will be to critically analyze and relate the material found in the young
adult sci-fi novel Feed by M.T. Anderson, as well as numerous other popular and scholarly
pieces of work (both through in-class reading and video analysis), to the lives of youth today. It
is clear that there is no small amount of anxiety and wonder that guides the current attitudes of
humans in relation to technology and media. Through in-class discussion we will attempt to
piece together an understanding as to what the interconnections between media, technology,
and the self are. More specifically, we will examine technological innovation as it pertains to
pressing topics such as; social media and its users, how to deal with climate change and
technological innovation, and in what ways technological development and its implementation
can shape cultural ideas about race and gender.
This course is meant to help those interested in not just the STEM disciplines, but anyone who
is interested in thinking more broadly about the technologies we use today and how they come
to shape who we are in the future.
Course Objectives
Students will learn:
-
 How critical concepts are shaped and applied within social science research surrounding
media, technology, and culture.
-
 How power, politics, and cultural identity are shaped through the development of new
scientific developments and devices.
-
 Experience writing collegiate-level papers that incorporate critical concepts, reasoning,
and real-world evidence.
-
 The possibilities for policy-making that shapes, and are shaped by everyday people.
Required text for the course:
M. T. Anderson – Feed
Provided texts for in-class reading:
Ursula K. Le Guin – A Rant About “Technology”
[http://www.ursulakleguin.com/Note-Technology.html]
Andy Clark – Natural Born Cyborgs, Introduction
Amit Katwala – The spiralling environmental cost of our lithium battery addiction
https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lithium-batteries-environment-impact
Learning Activities & Assignments
The course will be broken up into five distinct units of in-class activity. Additionally, each day will
consist of relating the assigned pages of Feed to that day's activity. Two students (working
separately) will be responsible for initiating the class discussion. All readings should be
completed before the assigned date, and you should come to class prepared to discuss.
Unit One: "Technology and Emotions” Pages 3 - 75, “Moon” Feed
This introductory exercise will involve analyzing the thoughts and feelings of the beginning
chapters of Feed. Students will be asked to complete two brief timed writing assignments in
which they will attempt to define the overarching mood or emotion that defines their generation.
Within the book, multiple psychological and emotional decisions are made in relation to the
technologies used in the future. How has media and technology either shaped or guided our
moods of today? Why does this mood or emotion specifically affect your generation and not
others? You can make up a new mood or term if one does not yet exist.
Unit Two: “Racist Algorithms and Hidden Big Data.” Pages 76 - 150, “Eden” Feed
On multiple occasions the narrative of Feed is guided by unseen protocols that function through
the major technological companies of the future. For this unit, students will engage in a video
analysis of an episode of the television show Black Mirror, “Nose Dive.” During this unit students
will learn about the hidden ways in which data can guide and influence our unconscious identity
structures. This unit hopes to critically examine the evolution of how we imagine fair, democratic
technologies and what utopia might be.
Unit Three: “Dead Technologies: Media Cultures Through the Past.” Pages 150 - 225, Feed
A major theme throughout the novel Feed is that of technological advancement. Numerous past
technologies are showcased alongside newly invented ones that shape the future, dystopian
world. This in-class activity will have students research and brainstorm the often neglected,
forgotten, and the non-obvious mediums, practices, and inventions we encounter everyday.
Students will then choose a technology from the past that is no longer in daily use and
reconsider how it might be useful in the future. Why has this invention simply gone away? Why
do some technologies make a return? What can we learn by revisiting these old inventions?
Unit Four: “Speculative Technologies.” Pages 225 - end of book Feed
Following our in-class dead technology exercise, students will draft a guide governing the
design, use, and/or implementation of a new technology. You must create or fundamentally
change a past technology to serve some sort of ethical purpose. The guide should be
constructed for an appropriate user in the future and should be 2-3 pages long. You should
include some statement explaining what ethical grounds the guide was written on, in addition to
your recommendations for development and use. This guide can be shaped in any way you like
(manifesto, ethical principles, guidelines, list of instructions/rules) as long as it makes sense for
your technology and intended audience. Be creative and have fun!
Once you have selected a technology you will write about what has helped to produce it. Is it
based on economic factors? Mental and/or physical health worries? Past technological impacts?
Historical events / traumas? Popular culture fads and phenomena? New opportunities for
self-growth? Evolving attitudes toward race, gender, sexuality etc?
Unit Five: In-class Presentations
Each student will present their guide examining a new technology they created. Each of the
presentations is a short version of the 2-3 page essay. It must be between 3-5 minutes (I will be
timing these presentations) So, practice is essential so that you know you can hit the 3-5 minute
zone. Two people in class will be asked to briefly respond to your presentation. Total time for
paper and discussion will be 7-8 minutes each. I hope that we find ways to make these
presentations lively and engaging!
